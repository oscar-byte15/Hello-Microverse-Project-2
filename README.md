# Hello Microverse Project:

In this project, I will set up a "Hello world" repository and message. My goal here is to master all of the tools and best practices that I learned in Microverse. 
I hope It demostrates my profesionalism and my capability to document any project in a rigth way!

Requirements:
- It has files like .html, and .css to show the message "Hello Microverse!"
- It has linters that works to detect some mistakes
- It has all the requirements asked for Microverse for this project
- It has a .gitignore file
- It has a README.md file to describe this project rigthly


Thanks,


Oscar De la Cruz
